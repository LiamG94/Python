# Python
Python code for networking, developed during the module *Infrastructure as Code*.  
This repository represents half of the work required for Assignment 2.  
The 'Development' branch was used all through development, with the 'Feature-1' branch being  
created to highlight how a specific feature can be developed seperately.
